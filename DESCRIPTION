Description: Provides neutral landscape models (<doi:10.1007/BF02275262>,
    <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/bf02275262>).  
    Neutral landscape models range from "hard" 
    neutral models (completely random distributed), to "soft" neutral models 
    (definable spatial characteristics) and generate landscape patterns that are 
    independent of ecological processes.
    Thus, these patterns can be used as null models in landscape ecology. 'NLMR' 
    combines a large number of algorithms from other published software for 
    simulating neutral landscapes. The simulation results are obtained in a
    spatial data format (raster* objects from the 'raster' package) and can,
    therefore, be used in any sort of raster data operation that is performed 
    with standard observation data.
